#   Abstract Factory:

#   Intent:
#   Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

#   Also known as: 
#           - Kit

#   Motivation:
#   <>

#   Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:
#       - A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
#       - A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products
#       - [{We need to enforce constraints on how a family of related product objects are used together}]
#       - Creating a library of products which reveal only their interfaces (not their implementations)
