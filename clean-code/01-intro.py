#   Code is the specification of program requirements in a machine-executable format.
#   Code is susceptible to a LeBlanc's Law: 'Later equals never'
#   Bad code kills productivity. Bad code encourages bad code.

#   Code is read far more than it is written.

#   Principles of clean code:
#       Elegance and efficient, makes bugs hard to hide. 
#       Bad code tries to do too much. Clean code does one thing well, things are undistracted by surrounding details.
#       Reads like prose. Has meaningful names. Lacks unnecessary detail.
#       Has (passing) unit/acceptance tests.
#       Contains no duplication.
#       Is simple, obvious, and compelling.

#   The boyscout rule: leave the campsite cleaner than you found it.
